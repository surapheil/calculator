# code, repeat

 The code is simple and easy to understand.also, to avoid eval() and constructor functions(prohibited in TOP curriculem) I used pure iteration for the application of operation precedence or PEDMAS rule. it does contain little repetetions and also needs a little more clean but left it as it is for a time being( thought not bad as a beginner) but I'll come back and re-fractor the code. 


# powerful iteration methods
Adding the event listners for numbers and operators wasn't easy without forEach method.Also, coding simple algorithms for precedence of operation was acheived by powerful for and while loop methods.

# Order of operations
for simple calculation of numbers I used 
                1.Multipication
                2.Division
                3.Modules
                4.Addition
                5.Subtraction 
 as order of precedence.Also, The algorithm is not 100% correct.


 N.B: please the '/' key in Firefox does not work well I recommed using ESC key after pressing the '/' key.
